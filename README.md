## Solution Future Aspects

- Booking of hotels, flights from the website
- Fine-tuning the model to get more accurate results for creating the itineraries
- AI-driven recommendations that would help users create a more fine-tuned itinerary
- Social network where users would be able to share their itineraries with others and collaborate
- Real-time collaboration for form filling when planning group trips
- Transition from monolithic backend to a microservices architecture
- Create a separate service for notifications
- Implement caching and additional fallback mechanisms to handle edge cases

## Alternate Solutions

- A microservices architecture could improve scalability and maintainability.
- A dedicated notification service could enhance the robustness of the alert system.
- Consider using a serverless architecture for handling different services independently
- Explore other ML models or services for itinerary generation

## Reproducing API Keys

To reproduce the API keys and secrets, ensure that sensitive information is managed securely using environment variables. Include example values in `.env.example` files and avoid committing real keys to version control.

## Pros and Cons of Proposed Solution

### Pros
- Streamlined and user-friendly interface
- Persona-based, budget, and duration-wise itinerary customization
- Clean architecture with a fallback mechanism
- Immediate email notifications

### Cons
- Monolithic backend structure; could benefit from microservices
- Notification system could be more robust as a separate service
- Potential for improvements with caching and additional fallback mechanisms

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   FIXME: Add GitHub URL here

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TechyMT/aivelnirary.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd aivelnirary/frontend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

    ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_here
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_id
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET=your_liveblocks_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key
    ```

5. Run the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Running Backend and ML Server

1. Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

    ```
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Navigate to the ML server directory and start the server using Gunicorn:

    ```
    cd ml
    npm install
    gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
